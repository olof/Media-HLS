Very much unusable at the moment. And on top of that, no API is
considered stable, and I will probably change very fundamental
stuff before 0.1 release.

I'm happy to take design feedback. I'm thinking about writing a
simple script that utilizes the module in some way, to make sure
the API feels natural and is usable. Until then, you can look at
t/02-hls.t for how it's supposed to be used.
